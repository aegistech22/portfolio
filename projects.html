      Below are representative projects and engagements.

    <!-- PROJECT 2 -->
    <h2>JavaScript Bug Fixing & Logic Repair</h2>

    <!-- PROJECT 3 -->
    <h2>Tool-Style Frontend Redesign</h2>

    <p><big>
      “The product started feeling like a tool

    <p><big>
      — D.K., Early-Stage Founder
    </big></p>

    <p><big>

    <!-- CLOSING -->
    <p><big>
      I prefer working on fewer projects
      where structure, clarity,
      and communication are taken seriously.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      Detailed discussions and honest feedback
      are central to how I approach work.
