    <p><big>
      AEGISTECH is a focused digital practice built around one idea:
      systems should work correctly before they look impressive.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      Founded and operated by <strong>Aditya Verma</strong>,
      the work here centers on web development,
      system stability,
      and problem-solving that holds up under real usage.
    </big></p>

    <!-- WHAT IT IS -->
    <h2 style="color:#22e6e6;">What this actually is</h2>

    <p><big>
      This is not a template site.
      It is not a marketing funnel.
      It is not designed to overwhelm.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      It is a working representation of how AEGISTECH approaches
      building digital systems: deliberate, restrained,
      and grounded in reality.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      Every section exists for a reason.
      Anything unnecessary is intentionally left out.
    </big></p>

    <hr style="border-color:#22e6e6;">

    <!-- VALUE -->
    <h2 style="color:#22e6e6;">What we focus on</h2>

    <p><big>
      The primary focus is reliability.
      Not just whether something works today,
      but whether it continues to work
      as usage increases and requirements change.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      This includes web platforms,
      interface behavior,
      JavaScript logic,
      and system-level stability.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      Problems are treated as structural questions,
      not isolated bugs.
    </big></p>

    <hr style="border-color:#22e6e6;">

    <!-- DIFFERENCE -->
    <h2 style="color:#22e6e6;">Why this approach is different</h2>

    <p><big>
      Many digital products are built to appear complete
      before they are structurally sound.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      At AEGISTECH, correctness comes first.
      Interfaces are designed to behave predictably.
      Logic is written to be readable and traceable.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      This reduces long-term maintenance cost,
      lowers recurring issues,
      and improves confidence in the system overall.
    </big></p>

    <hr style="border-color:#22e6e6;">

    <!-- PROCESS -->
    <h2 style="color:#22e6e6;">How work is handled</h2>

    <p><big>
      Work is handled through a structured process:
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      • Understanding the actual problem<br>
      • Identifying constraints and risks<br>
      • Designing clear system boundaries<br>
      • Implementing with restraint and precision<br>
      • Verifying behavior under realistic conditions
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      This avoids rushed decisions
      and prevents instability later.
    </big></p>

    <hr style="border-color:#22e6e6;">

    <!-- WHO -->
    <h2 style="color:#22e6e6;">Who this is for</h2>

    <p><big>
      AEGISTECH works best with individuals and teams
      who value clarity, honesty, and long-term thinking.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      If the goal is speed at any cost,
      this may not be the right fit.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      If the goal is building something stable,
      understandable, and dependable,
      alignment is likely.
    </big></p>

    <hr style="border-color:#22e6e6;">

    <!-- SITE ITSELF -->
    <h2 style="color:#22e6e6;">About this website</h2>

    <p><big>
      This website is intentionally lightweight.
      There are no heavy frameworks,
      no hidden complexity,
      and no unnecessary dependencies.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      Navigation is controlled.
      Transitions are deliberate.
      Structure is prioritized over decoration.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      In practice, this site functions
      as a quiet demonstration of how AEGISTECH prefers systems to behave.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      Further details about services and past work
      are available through the other sections of the site.
    </big></p>

    <p><big>
      When ready,
      communication can begin directly
      without unnecessary formalities.
